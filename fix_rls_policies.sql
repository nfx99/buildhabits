-- Fix Row Level Security policies
-- This will allow the app to work without user_id filtering

-- Check current RLS status
SELECT 'Current RLS status:' as info;
SELECT schemaname, tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE tablename IN ('habits', 'habit_completions');

-- Check existing policies
SELECT 'Current policies on habits:' as info;
SELECT policyname, permissive, roles, cmd, qual 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'habits';

SELECT 'Current policies on habit_completions:' as info;
SELECT policyname, permissive, roles, cmd, qual 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'habit_completions';

-- Option 1: Disable RLS entirely (simplest solution)
ALTER TABLE habits DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE habit_completions DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Option 2: If you want to keep RLS but allow all operations, 
-- uncomment these lines instead of the above:
/*
-- Drop existing restrictive policies

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can only insert their own habits" ON habits;
